Your exploration of the data seems thorough and involves analyzing a dataset containing information about employees' demographics, job details, and salaries. Here's a breakdown of what you've done and how you might improve further:

Key Steps Already Taken:
Library Imports and Installation:

You successfully installed pandas and numpy and verified their availability.

Data Analysis:

Loaded the dataset using pd.read_csv() and inspected columns like Age, Gender, and Years of Experience.
Checked for missing values with isnull() and isnull().sum() and handled them using dropna().

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identified unique values in Education Level and calculated its count using unique() and nunique().
Created a dictionary to count occurrences of unique job titles.

Debugging Potential Errors:

Found that the float(sum(data["Salary"])) calculation resulted in NaN, likely due to missing or invalid entries in the column.
